# Overview
Created for marking p-wave arrivals for waveforms using manual user input, saves user clicked x axis positions as a separate csv file for further analysis. 
Accepted waveform file formats are .hdf5, .hdf, and .csv <br>
for .hdf5 and .hdf the script reads traces from a root folder named "data" and the traces from "data/bucket0" as well as sampling rate and component order from 
"data_format/sampling_rate" and "data_format/component_order" respectively
